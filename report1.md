**Installing VScode**
Go to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download and install VSCode for your system. Once you open VSCode, the screenshot should look like this:

**Remotely Connecting**
Now we can connect to the virtual servers for CSE 15L called ieng6. Open a file or create any file in VSCode (name it anything you want) and go to terminal on the bottom. Here we can type commands and remotley connect. For mac, you can just go to the app called 'Terminal'. If you have Windows, you can download git bash for VSCode specifically. No matter how you choose to connect remotley, type in ssh (secure shell) and your account to login to the ieng6 servers!
<br>
`ssh cs15lwi23abc@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
<br>
This uses your username for the class "cs15lwi23abc" but "abc" is specific to your account. After logging in, information will be printed to you like this:
![Connection](/connect.png?raw=true "Remote Connection")
<br>
Once you are logged in after typing your correct password and typing "yes" to allow a remote connection, we can try some commands. Here are a list of useful commands:
![HelloWorld](/helloworld.png?raw=true "HelloWorld")
